## Issues Found:

1. **Agent 16 - Missing hover effects on Factory/Agent CTA buttons**: The CTA buttons in the AudienceSection component (lines 176-181) do not have the `hover:scale-105` and `active:scale-95` classes applied. They only have basic styling without the interactive hover/active effects.

## What Still Needs Fixing:

1. **AudienceSection CTA Button**: Add `hover:scale-105` and `active:scale-95` classes to the CTA button element (line 178 in `AudienceSection.tsx`) to match the interactive behavior of other buttons throughout the site.
